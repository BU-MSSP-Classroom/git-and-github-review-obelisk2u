## What I learned
I learned about forking and pull requests. I have had a lot of experience with Git in the past but never had to apply forking or pull requests

## What I still don't understand
If I have a super popular repository that people are constantly wanting to contribute to, can anybody make a pull request? Is it up to me to go through hundreds of requests?
